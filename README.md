# ExKG-Datasets-

These datasets were crawled from SIMET, a scientific measurement system that provides information about professors from two universities in Iran. The abbreviation FUM represents Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, while SBU represents Shahid Beheshti University. In the SBU dataset, certain field values are labeled as 'Root' because they lacked any mappable value in the Knowledge Graph (KG). In the final dataset, we removed records that contained the 'Root' value in the field column.
